## Hey 👋

        Thanks for visiting my site, I hope you like it.

        Working on this project has been very helpful to me in understanding CI/CD pipelines and gain a deeper understanding into CSS styling and designing responsive web pages. I recommend you to develop your own portfolio website and learn to deploy it. Have a great day!
